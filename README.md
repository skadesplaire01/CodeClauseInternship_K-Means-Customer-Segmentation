# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project is a Streamlit web application that performs K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their behavior. It helps businesses identify customer groups using two numerical features (e.g., Annual Income and Spending Score) for effective marketing and personalized service strategies.

📁 Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/nelakurthisudheer/mall-customer-segmentation
This dataset contains demographic and purchasing data for customers at a mall. It's commonly used for customer segmentation using K-Means.

The dataset consists of following five features of 200 customers:

- CustomerID – Unique ID for each customer

- Gender – Male/Female

- Age – Age of the customer

- Annual Income (k$) – Annual income in thousands

- Spending Score (1-100) – Score assigned based on purchasing behavior

🔍Interpretation :

This customer segmentation app provides a visual and analytical way to understand customer behavior by clustering them into distinct groups using K-Means.

By analyzing patterns in features like Annual Income, Age, or Spending Score, businesses can:

- Identify high-value customers (e.g., high income & high spending)

- Spot price-sensitive customers or those with low engagement

- Tailor marketing strategies for each segment

- Improve personalized services and customer retention

The interactive nature of the app—allowing you to test different features and cluster counts—makes it a powerful tool for data exploration and business decision-making.
